# Basic-Portfolio

This is a website structured for a portfolio of projects.


## Description

This website for a basic portfolio was the result of exploring uses of HTML and CSS for structuring and styling webpages.

## Usage

Use of these webpages is limited; as this project was focused solely on playing with HTML and CSS, the portfolio page contains static images and is not populated with links to any applications, and the contact form does not have full functionality.
